<h1> About me </h1>
<h2>My name is Sidney,</h2>
<p>I have been practicing with photography since I was 12,
    I fell in love with the idea of capturing beauty in the world.
    I am 18 years old, and working in portrait photography. 
    I love capturing people, their beautiful smiles, and their personalities.
    I love photography because it’s a chance to get to know people and to 
    show my creativity.Getting to know people is so special to me because 
    everyone is their own kind of unique. It’s a way to inspire and encourage
    others, It makes people feel beautiful and happy. Photography makes me happy,
    and my goal is to make others happy with my photography.
