<h2>v2</h2>
<p>I did not include an image map becuase it does not go with my website.
I did not add transparency (M4LO6 Demonstrate the use of opacity/transparency for images) 
my page is about photography and all images need to be at full opacity and transparency
to be appreciated. </p>
<p>Index page,
    I took the images out of the header so I can use float and clear on them. 
</p>
<p>Services,
    I added an image for the Mini Sessions and made it a figure box (this will go
    away in v3). 
</p>
<p>Contact me,
    I added a gradient to the background. I also made a seperate stylesheet for this page.
</p>
<p>On all pages,
    I added rounded corners to the bottom left and right corners and also added a
    text shadow to the address. 
</p>
<h2>v3</h2>
<p>I did not include 'M5LO4 Use CSS for pull-down menus' becuase I found it unnecessary
   for my website.</p>
<p>Index Page,
    I moved the image back into the hearder where it was in v1 and added the second
    image back in.
</p>
<p>Services,
    I got rid of the figure box becuase it did not flow with the simplicity of site.
    I added in more pictures for the mini sessions section of the page.
</p>
<p>Contact Me,
    I addded a table to show the availability for the photographer's week.
</p>
<p>Overall, on all pages I created the format for mobile and PCs and also added 
    M5LO5, M5LO6, M5LO7 (those include- flex-direction, flex-wrap, flex-flow, width,
    height, flex, -webkit-order, -webkit-flex, -webkit-flex-flow, order, display)
</p>
<h2>v4</h2>
<p>I did not include the module 8 objectives because neither the iframe or annimation
    made sence to include into my project.</p>
<p>Contact Me,
    I added a Check List to give the option of recieving emails, Selection
    List to book a session, and a submit button to send the information
    to the photographer.</p>
<p>Services,
    I rearranged the photos and added more reviews.
